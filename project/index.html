        <img src="lionel_messi_player-full.jpg" alt="">
        <p><b>Lionel Andrés Messi</b> (born 24 June 1987 in Rosario) is an Argentine international football player who
            played
            for FC Barcelona in the Primera División, and appears on Argentina's national team. Often touted in the
            media as New Maradona, Messi has been publicly named as his "successor" by Diego Maradona himself.



            He is regarded as the best football player of his generation and one of the best in the history of the
            sport. Messi received several Ballon d'Or and FIFA World Player of the Year nominations by the age of 21,
            and won in 2009 and 2010.

            <b>Lionel Messi</b> was born in Santa Fe Province on 24 June 1987. At the age of five, he started playing football for
            Grandoli, a club coached by his father. In 1995, Messi switched to Newell's Old Boys. At the age of 11, he was diagnosed
            with a growth hormone deficiency.


            River Plate showed interest in Messi's progress, but did not have enough money to pay for the treatment of the illness,
            which cost over £500 a month. As Argentina's economy was collapsing, Carles Rexach, then sporting director of FC
            Barcelona, was made aware of Messi's talent, and Barcelona signed him after watching him play, offering to pay for the
            medical bills if he was willing to move to start a new life in Spain. His family moved with the young player to Europe
            and he starred in the club’s youth teams.



            He soon found himself starting for the Barcelona B team, averaging more than a goal per atches.



            In October 2004, Messi made his official début for the first team against RCD Espanyol, becoming the third-youngest
            player egame, by scoring 35 goals in 30
            mver to play for FC Barcelona. When he scored his first senior goal for the club against Albacete Balompié on May
            1, 2005, Messi was 17 years, 10 months and 7 days old, becoming the youngest to ever score in a La Liga game for FC
            Barcelona.

        Lionel Messi’s Barcelona Career Is the History of Modern Soccer
        With Messi set for a shocking exit from Barcelona, we're looking back at “the greatest stretch of athletic
        excellence we’ve ever seen—and probably ever will see.”

        It was preseason, back in 2005. Juventus's Patrick Vieira was the most dominant midfielder in the world: a
        gangly 6-foot-3 colossus, able to break up any attack that dares come near him and just as easily push play
        forward with the ball at his feet. Samuel Eto’o, meanwhile, had just started to make his case as the Vieira of
        strikers. He had the near-performative tenacity of a Duke point guard, but with world-class speed, top-tier
        strength, and elite ball control. At the time, Eto’o was coming off of his first season with Barcelona, where
        he’d scored 24 goals and led the Catalan club to their first La Liga title in six years.

        Barcelona and Juventus were about to contest the Gamper Trophy, an exhibition match Barcelona plays at the
        beginning of every season in honor of Joan Gamper, one of the founders of the club. Both Eto’o and Vieira were
        at the top of their craft, the 99.99th percentile of practitioners at their positions, but when Eto’o met up
        with his buddy before the match, he didn’t wanna talk about himself, didn’t wanna ask Vieira how things were
        going, none of that. No, Eto’o had a warning. He pointed across the pitch at a gnomish 18-year-old with a
        terrible haircut and translucent skin. “I told him”, Eto’o said, “one day it would seem like every player who
        came before Messi was playing a different sport.”

        Sixteen years later, it’s safe to say that Eto’o was right. On Thursday, FC Barcelona announced that Lionel
        Messi “shall not be staying on at FC Barcelona.” It was an abrupt announcement, prompted by the club’s lavish
        spending over the past half-decade and the contracting effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on revenues. It’s
        possible something still gets worked out—soccer finances are part magic—but there’s a real chance this is
        actually the end of Messi in the red and blue stripes. And if it is, it’s also the end of the greatest stretch
        of athletic excellence we’ve ever seen—and probably ever will see.

        After finishing second behind Ronaldo in the rankings in 2008, Messi picked up his first Ballon d’Or one year
        later.

        It was the first of four in a row the then-Barcelona star would claim as his rivalry with the Portuguese
        attacker dominated elite football.

        He lost out to Ronaldo in 2013 and 2014 before being named No.1 again the following year. He had to wait until
        2015 for his fifth award, then the sixth came along in 2019.

        He's now padded his tally in 2021, moving up to seven in his career. For <a
